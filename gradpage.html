      <h2>Career Path</h2>
      <p>
        Out of all of the emphases I could pick in this program, I am most drawn to nonprofit management. As I have
        taken classes and gotten more experience in this subject matter, I have realized that I would like to do this
        full-time when I graduate. After graduation, I hope to get a job at an NGO and continue to make an impact in the
        lives of vulnerable people around the world.

      <h2>Internship at One Refugee</h2>
      <p>
        I started interning at One Refugee in November to gain experience in the nonprofit sector. I am very passionate
        about helping connect refugees to resources that can help them, so this experience brought together a lot of my
        skills and interests. In April, I extended my internship through the summer. I'm excited to continue working for
        this outstanding organization!

      <h2>Anticipated Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        After my first semester in the MPA program, I decided to minor in Information Systems. I believe my technical
        skills will be valuable to whatever nonprofit organization I work for in the future, as many struggle with
        creating aesthetic websites and automating tasks.
